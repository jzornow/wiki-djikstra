        or from [[pork belly]]. The side cut has less fat than the belly. In the US
        \"bacon\" implies belly bacon, with leaner cuts known as \"Canadian bacon\".

        [[Club sandwich]]). Bacon is also used for [[larding|barding and larding]]
        roasts, especially game, including [[venison]] and [[pheasant]]. The word
        is derived from the [[Old High German]] ''''bacho'''', meaning \"buttock\",

        pork]] and [[ham]] by differences in the brine (or dry packing). Bacon brine
        has added curing ingredients, most notably [[sodium nitrite]], and occasionally
        [[potassium nitrate]] ([[saltpeter]]); [[sodium ascorbate]] or [[erythorbate]]
        are added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour. Flavourings such as [[brown
        sugar]] or [[maple]] are used for some products. Sodium polyphosphates, such
        as [[sodium triphosphate]], may be added to make the produce easier to slice
        and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine for ham,
        but not bacon, includes a large amount of sugar. Historically, \"ham\" and
        \"bacon\" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically,
        often together in the same barrel.\n\n== Curing and smoking bacon ==\n[[File:Hickory
        smoked barbecue bacon.jpg|thumb|Smoke cured bacon, then cooked with additional
        hickory smoke]]\nBacon is cured through either a process of injecting with
        or soaking in brine or using plain salt (dry curing).<ref name=\"About Foodreference\"
        />\n\nIn America, bacon is usually [[curing (food preservation)|cured]] and
        [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]], and different flavours can be achieved by using
        various types of wood, or rarely [[corn cobs]]; [[peat]] is sometimes used
        in the [[United Kingdom]]. This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending
        on the intensity of the flavour desired. ''''The Virginia Housewife'''' (1824),
        thought to be one of the earliest American cookbooks, gives no indication
        that bacon is ever ''''not'''' smoked, though it gives no advice on flavouring,
        noting only that care should be taken lest the fire get too hot.<ref>{{cite

        ''Back bacon'' refers to either smoked or unsmoked bacon cut from the boneless
        eye of pork loin;<ref name=\"Canadian Oxford Dictionary 2004\" /> this is
        called ''Canadian bacon'' in the United States when cut into a thick medallion
        shape.\n* [[Peameal bacon]] is back bacon, brined and coated in fine cornmeal
        (historically, it was rolled in a meal made from ground dried [[peas]]).<ref
        name=\"Canadian Oxford Dictionary 2004\" />\n* Bacon is often eaten in breakfasts,
        such as with cooked eggs or pancakes.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Speck-1.jpg|thumb|Above:

        overlap with the German-language term ''''[[Speck]]''''. Germans use the term
        ''''bacon'''' explicitly for ''''Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksspeck'''' (''breakfast
        ''''Speck''''<nowiki/>'') which are cured or smoked pork slices. Traditional
        German [[cold cut]]s favor ham over bacon, however \"Wammerl\" (grilled pork
        belly) remains popular in Bavaria.\n\nSmall bacon cubes (called \"Grieben\"
        or \"Grammerln\" in Austria and southern Germany) have been a rather important
        ingredient of various southern German dishes. They are used for adding flavor
        to soups and salads and for speck dumplings and various noodle and potato
        dishes. Instead of preparing them at home from larger slices, they began to
        be sold ready made as [[convenience food]]s recently as \"Baconw\u00fcrfel\"
        (\"bacon cubes\") in German retail stores.\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan, bacon

        United Kingdom and Ireland ===\nA thin slice of bacon is known as a ''rasher''.<ref

        The term ''bacon'' on its own does not specify the cut but typically refers
        to back bacon.\n* Bacon from the pork belly, with streaks of meat and fat,
        is referred to as ''streaky bacon''.\n* Bacon from the back of the pig is
        referred to as ''back bacon'', and usually includes a streaky bit and a lean
        oval bit.\n* Middle cuts with an eye of meat and an extended streaky section
        are common.\n* Heavily trimmed back cuts which may consist of just the eye
        of meat are available.\n\nBacon may be cured in several ways; in particular
        it may be described as smoked or unsmoked. Many ways of curing add water to
        the meat; bacon sold as \"dry cured\" does not have added water. For example,
        in a shop a particular type may be described as \"dry-cured unsmoked back
